# DDR2 Controller Project


# Objective and Overview

The goal of this project is to improve substantial skills in DRAM and complex hardware IPs.
You'll use SystemVerilog to implement a DRAM controller IP for DDR2 (or its successors).
Your controller will receive AXI requests and exercise a DDR2 model (Micron 512Mb DDR2).
